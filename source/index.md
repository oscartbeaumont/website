* Open Source ([Github](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont), [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))

I have a passion for technology. I love to learn new things and teach other people in the process. I learnt technology through hours of research and experimenting and have since spent thousands of hours learning and increasing my technological skills. Have a look at my projects on this website or GitHub to see my skills in action. Contact me if you would like to hire me or if you have any other questions.
