Hello There,
My name is Oscar Beaumont, I am a high school student, developer and a tech enthusiast.

* Open Source Software ([Github](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont), [Publishing MIT Licensed Code](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Robotics ([Lego Mindstorms EV3 Robots](https://www.lego.com/mindstorms/about-ev3), [Robocup Junior Competition](http://www.robocupjunior.org.au/))

I have a passion for technology. I love to learn new things and teach other people in the process. I learnt technology through hours of research and experimenting and have since spent thousands of hours learning and increasing my technological skills. Have a look at my projects on this website or GitHub to see my skills in action. Contact me if you would like to hire me or if you have any other questions.
